In these projects, the primary problem I was solving was how to store, organize, and access course and bid information efficiently using different data structures. The work required me to compare vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to see which was best for the advising system at ABCU. Data structures are important because they directly affect how quickly and efficiently data can be inserted, searched, and retrieved. By practicing with multiple options, I learned not only how each structure works, but also why the right choice of structure matters depending on the problem being solved.

My approach was to follow an incremental process: first building the pseudocode to design the logic, then implementing the code while carefully testing each function against requirements. Along the way, I encountered roadblocks like handling file input with CSV data and properly resolving collisions in hash tables. I overcame these issues by breaking the problems into smaller steps, reviewing sample code, and debugging through test runs until the logic matched the expected output. This taught me persistence and the value of using modular, reusable functions.

Working through these assignments expanded how I think about designing software. I realized that it’s not only about making code run, but also about writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I applied consistent variable naming, inline comments, and a modular structure so that each method does one clear job. This makes the code easier for another developer—or myself in the future—to understand and modify. These projects helped me grow from just “writing code” to developing programs that follow industry best practices and can serve as a foundation for larger, real-world systems.
